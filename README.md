presto-extensions
=================

A set of chrome content scripts that add some convenience features to Presto.

The [only current script](presto-extensions/presto-extensions/clearfront.js) adds a button to the "Manage Fronts" page that removes all content from the current front, giving content programmers a clean slate to work with.

I would hope that anyone working with presto would find these helpful. If you have a script you already use and find helpful, please submit a pull request to share it with others.
